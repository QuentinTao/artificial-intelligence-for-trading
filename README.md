# Artificial Intelligence For Trading. 

This repository contains all the quizzes and projects that I have completed for the Udacity AI for Trading Nanodegree. 

## Course Overview

### Part1: [Quantitative Trading](https://github.com/prakharrathi25/artificial-intelligence-for-trading/tree/master/part1_quantitative_trading)

Learnt the basics of quantitative analysis, including data processing, trading signal generation, and portfolio management. Used Python to work with historical stock data, develop trading strategies, and construct a multi-factor model with optimization.

1. **Basic Quantitative Trading** : Learnt about market mechanics and how to generate signals with stock data. Work on developing a momentum-trading strategy in your first project.

2. **Advanced Quantitative Trading** : Picked up the quant workflow for signal generation, and apply advanced quantitative methods commonly used in trading.

3. **Stocks, Indices, and ETFs** : Learnt about portfolio optimization, and financial securities formed by stocks, including market indices, vanilla ETFs, and Smart Beta ETFs.

4. **Factor Investing and Alpha Research** : Learnt the fundamentals of text processing, and analyze corporate filings to generate sentiment-based trading signals.

After learning about these concepts, I also implemented them and the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/prakharrathi25/artificial-intelligence-for-trading/tree/master/part1_quantitative_trading/projects). 

### Part2: [AI Algortihms in Trading](https://github.com/prakharrathi25/artificial-intelligence-for-trading/tree/master/part2_ai_algorithms_in_trading)

Learnt how to analyze alternative data and use machine learning to generate trading signals. I also ran backtests to evaluate and combine top performing signals.

1. **Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing** : Studied the fundamentals of text processing, and analyze corporate filings to generate sentiment-based trading signals.

2. **Advanced Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning** : Applied deep learning in quantitative analysis and used recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory to generate trading signals.

3. **Combining Multiple Signals** : Advanced techniques to select and combine the factors generated from both traditional and alternative data.

4. **Simulating Trades with Historical Data** : Refine trading signals by running rigorous back tests and tracking P&L while my algorithm buys and sells.


After learning about these concepts, I also implemented them and the projects can be found [here](https://github.com/prakharrathi25/artificial-intelligence-for-trading/tree/master/part2_ai_algorithms_in_trading/projects).
